In this project, we meticulously cleanse and curate a comprehensive dataset of bike rides in London. Our focus is on developing an interactive visualization using Tableau, which not only presents the total number of rides over a selected period but also integrates key environmental factors such as wind conditions and temperature. This dynamic tool features an adjustable time frame, enabling users to select specific periods and instantly view the corresponding ride statistics and associated weather characteristics.
